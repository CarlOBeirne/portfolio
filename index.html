        <h3>Flatiron Building at Sunset</h3>
        <p>On my recent trip to New York City, I wanted to get a photo of the Flatiron building. When I arrived during the day I was a little dissapointed after discovering that there was scaffolding around the building for rennovations. I returned at sunset and pictured one of my favourite photos of the trip, with a beautiful purple and organge glow from the sun setting in the background up the streets.</p>

        <h3>Empire State Building</h3>
        <p>Ive seen so many pretty photos of the Empire State Building with beautiful skies taken from Helicopter tours and from other highrise viewpoints. I pictured the photo in my head of what I wanted, however, the weather had other ideas. It was an overcast day on my visit to the Top of the Rock (The Rockefeller Building viewpoint) and I did not get the photo I had visioned. Nonetheless, I still got a photo that will stay with me fore a lifetime. Seeing the entire Downtown Manhattan, with the Empire State Building, The One World Trade Center & The Statue of Liberty all in one photo is breathtaking.</p>

        <h3>Statue of Liberty</h3>
        <p>A rivercruise down the Hudson River took us from Midtown Manhattan along the coastline, and down past lady liberty, The Statue of Liberty. The boat trip started off with a very foggy day, with most of the skyline under cloud cover. However, by the time we arrived to the Statue of Liberty, the weather had improved and was able to get this photo of The Statue of Liberty. When you get up close to the island, the staute becomes much taller than you initially imagine.</p>
